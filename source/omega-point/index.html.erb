      EXCERPT from LYDIA NSIAH’S ESSAY “THE IMAGE OF THE INBETWEEN IN THE PHOTOFILM OMEGA POINT”: The clouds appear to move intermittently in the sky above Cap Ferret. Several bunkers, which have almost entirely sunken in the sea and sand, are scanned by the photo-camera. Waves break on them. The viewfinder moves in the panorama, and focuses one of the objects: "NOS!"/"WE!" is written on it. [...]
      </p>
      <p>
      [...] With the fusion of photography and film in "Hybrid Fotofilm“ the attributions of two differently perceived media are enhanced with a new, invisible and fictive production of images. The blanks between the filmic animated photographs and their saccadic movement are filled with intermediate images.
      "Time hovers [in photofilm] between present and past, between the captured and projected. [It] becomes 'present', although it cannot be artificially [like in film] reconstructed. [...] Time and motion, again, become part of imagination."
