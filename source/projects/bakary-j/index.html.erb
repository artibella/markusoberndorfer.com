      <h1>ABOUT THE PROJECT: </h1>
      <p>
      One of my photographic excursions lead me into an abandonned depot in vienna. I took a photo of a stickman, whose face - originally on a board on the wall - was lying on the floor; scrunched. Some weeks after that the asylum seeker Bakary J. was abused and nearly beaten to death by an alien branch of the austrian police in that same building.
