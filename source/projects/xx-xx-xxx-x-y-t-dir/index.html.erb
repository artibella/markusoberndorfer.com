     What is it that we see? Is it where I was in the "now of the image", or is it the situation you find yourself in entering an image in the exhibitions space itself?

      <h1>ABOUT THE PROJECT: </h1>
      <p>
      "Ortsmarkierung ohne Namen" (E: untitled placemark) is a work relating to the term of the "lived space". The title itself also includes the variables X and Y representing the coordinate system, aswell as the variable for time t and dir for direction/perspective in search for an horizon. All these variables ultimately get assigned to the location (not where I was when I took the photo) but to where the lightbox is shown or exhibited/ where the spectator is and enters the image (in his/her time and space). If you now for example have both lightboxes in one exhibition - facing each other; or in an entirely different room - the two different frames of ONE original photo (lightboxes) will each have different location marks, different timestamps and perspectives. All of which could - by the irritation of seeing the "same place" twice (two lightboxes) in one room or show - makes the the spectator think: Why? 
      </p>
      <p>
      In last consequence the photo from the installed lightboxes (representing the time when I saw it) generates the entire title and freezes again my personal "lived space".
