      <h1>ABOUT THE PROJECT:</h1>
      <p>
      View I had and room in which I lived for one week during my artist residency at KÃ¶lnbreinsperre attributed by Verbund. During that time in which it seemed to rain nonstop I also produced a short song called Lenscapes #02, that is the soundtrack to that image and also featured on the vinylpostcard. I had to leave this room due to medical issues and spent one week in hospital. I returned after three weeks for one more week to continue with a series called "Vor Ort".
